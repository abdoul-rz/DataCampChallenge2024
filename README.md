# RAMP starting kit on Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Introduction

Being able to detect fraudulent transactions is of utmost importance for any credit card company in order to protect their customers from theft but also to protect themselves from financial losses.

In this challenge, we will use a dataset of credit card transactions to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. The dataset is anonymized and contains a mixture of numerical and categorical features. The goal is to design an algorithm that can accurately predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.

## Getting started

### Install

To run a submission and the notebook you will need the dependencies listed
in `requirements.txt`. You can install the dependencies with the
following command-line:

```bash
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

If you are using `conda`, we also provide an `environment.yml` file for similar usage.

### Challenge description

Get started on this RAMP with the
[dedicated notebook](fraud_detection_starting_kit.ipynb).

### Test a submission

The submissions need to be located in the `submissions` folder. For instance
for `my_submission`, it should be located in `submissions/my_submission`.

To run a specific submission, you can use the `ramp-test` command line:

```bash
ramp-test --submission my_submission
```

You can get more information regarding this command line:

```bash
ramp-test --help
```
